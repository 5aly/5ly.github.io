<h1 style="color:saddlebrown; font-style: ;">WHY I CONSIDER YOU AS MY BEST FRIEND...</h1>
<P>
    For starters you are kind. Even if u dont think so.<br>You make me laugh when im feeling sad.<br>
    I know I suck at expressing my feeelings and ure not used to me expressing them.
    i dont know why but everybody sees me as a emotionless creature. I may not show it but deep down u mean the world to me.
    I may ignore u from time to time. its not because ure annoying or boring <mark>(dont u dare think that)</mark>.Its just that sometimes i feel like being alone and need some time to gather my thoughts.<br><strong>you are my bsf and always will be.</strong>

    <br>so back to why i consider you as my bsf
    u always look out for me.
    even when ure sad u always think about my feelings.
    even when im the one hurting you.
    u put so much effort to spend time with me that most of the times i feel guilty that im not even trying.
    It may look like i dont care but i really do.<br>
    u are my RIDE OR DIE gurl... 

</P>
<h2 style="color: black;font-style: italic;">love u to the moon and back</h2>
